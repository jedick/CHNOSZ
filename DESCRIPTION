Description: An integrated set of tools for thermodynamic calculations in geochemistry and compositional
  biology. The thermodynamic properties of liquid water are calculated using Fortran code from
  SUPCRT92 (Johnson et al., 1992 <doi:10.1016/0098-3004(92)90029-Q>) or an implementation
  in R of the IAPWS-95 formulation (Wagner and Pruß, 2002 <doi:10.1063/1.1461829>).
  Thermodynamic properties of other species are taken from a database for minerals and inorganic
  and organic aqueous species including biomolecules, or from amino acid group additivity for
  proteins (Dick et al., 2006 <doi:10.5194/bg-3-311-2006>). High-temperature properties are
  calculated using the Berman-Brown (1985) <doi:10.1007/BF00379451> equations for minerals
  and the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (1981) <doi:10.2475/ajs.281.10.1249> equations for
  aqueous species. The HKF equations are augmented with the Deep Earth Water (DEW) model
  (Sverjensky et al., 2014 <doi:10.1016/j.gca.2013.12.019>) and estimates of parameters in the
  extended Debye-Hückel equation (Manning et al., 2013 <doi:10.2138/rmg.2013.75.5>)
  to calculate standard-state properties and activity coefficients for given ionic strength at high
  pressure (to 6 GPa). Functions are provided to calculate standard-state properties of species and
  reactions, define the basis species of a chemical system, automatically balance reactions, calculate
  the chemical affinities of formation reactions for selected species, calculate the equilibrium
  activities of those species, and plot the results on chemical activity diagrams.
