[to 20201110]

- Make a site for community uploaded data

- Use separate directories for default and optional data files

- diagram(): produce error or warning for NA values of affinity

- Move protein.equil() example (previously in equilibrium.Rnw) to JMDplots.

- Add elements from Robie and Hemingway (1995).

- Add check to mosaic() that 'stable' values have the right dimensions.

- Move H2O92D.f and R wrapper to a separate package (so people
don't have to compile anything to install CHNOSZ updates).

- Add hint to anintro.Rmd to try exceed.Ttr = TRUE if there is a blank diagram.

- Replace CoCl4-2 example in anintro.Rmd with different species
(CoCl4-2 has been added to OBIGT).

[20201113 - ]

- Add a demo to show user-added data with Berman equations

- Make swap.basis() work when DEW model is active

[20210303]

- Add demo for effective equilibrium constant for diglycine on T-pH plot at
  high pressure (DEW model; Robinson et al., 2021)

[20210426]

- anintro.Rmd: Make bold Fe-bearing mineral names in first mosaic stacking diagram

[20210711]

- Merge SK95.csv into SLOP98.csv

[20220203]

- Allow numeric values for bases in mosaic() (test-mix.R)

- Add a 'model' column to thermo()$OBIGT to indicate the thermodynamic data
  model (e.g. H2O, HKF, CGL, Berman, AD, or DEW)

[20220209]

- Add units = c(T.units, P.units, E.units) to output of subcrt()

- Add units = c(T.units, P.units) to output of affinity()

[20220422]

- Re-enter data from PS01 and AP01 (original units in J not cal)

- subcrt(): Don't output properties in HKF region 4

[20220503]

- Don't use palply in read.fasta()
