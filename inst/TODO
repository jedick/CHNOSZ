- make a site for community uploaded data

- make separate directories for default and optional data files

- diagram(): make error or warning for NA values of affinity

- move protein.equil() example (previously in equilibrium.Rnw) to JMDplots.

- move extdata/bison to JMDplots package.

- add elements from RH95.

- add check to mosaic() that 'stable' values have the right dimensions.

- anintro.Rmd, help files: make it clear that species with
different units (cal, J) in OBIGT can be used in subcrt, diagrams, etc.
in CHNOSZ.

- move H2O92D.f and R wrapper to a separate package (so people
don't have to compile anything to install CHNOSZ updates).

- add empty diagram -> exceed.Ttr hint to anintro.Rmd.

- replace CoCl2-4 example in anintro.Rmd with different species
(CoCl2-4 has been added to OBIGT).

[20201113 - ]

- add a demo to show user-added data with Berman equations

- make swap.basis() work when DEW model is active

- Show species name in message: mod.OBIGT(5, G = 0)

- Check that protein ionization calculations are not affected by E.units()
library(testthat)
reset()
basis(c("CO2", "H2", "NH4+", "H2O", "H2S", "H+"))
a1 <- affinity(iprotein = 1)
E.units("J")
a2 <- affinity(iprotein = 1)
expect_equal(a1$values, a2$values)

- diagram(): scale predominant.values in output by balancing coefficients?

- add HKF parameters from LaRowe and Amend, 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2015.227)

BUG: Why doesn't this work?
> basis("QEC")
> subcrt("LYSC_CHICK", 1/129)
Error in count.elements(formula) : 
  'C2.15503876355161e-07H3.72868217191069e-07O1.72868217157562eZ-7' is not a simple chemical formula

[20210116]

- Add an option to disable use of ionize.aa() (it's always active if the basis species have H+)

[20210122] Fix incorrect states in messages:
> subcrt("C10H22")
info.character: found C10H22(decane); other available phases are gas, gas, gas, liq, liq, liq
> subcrt("C10H22", "liq")
info.character: found C10H22(liq); other available states are liq, liq

[20210201]

- Move alunite from SUPCRT92.csv to inorganic_cr.csv.

[20210212]

- Fix formatting of messages from palply() (seen with read.fasta())

[20210219]

- Don't use data(thermo) in demo Shiny app (citrate)

- Check all mineral abbreviations in Berman_cr.csv.
