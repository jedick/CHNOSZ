- make a site for community uploaded data

- make separate directories for default and optional data files

- diagram(): make error or warning for NA values of affinity

- move protein.equil() example (previously in equilibrium.Rnw) to JMDplots.

- move extdata/bison to JMDplots package.

- add elements from RH95.

- add check to mosaic() that 'stable' values have the right dimensions.

- move H2O92D.f and R wrapper to a separate package (so people
don't have to compile anything to install CHNOSZ updates).

- add empty diagram -> exceed.Ttr hint to anintro.Rmd.

- replace CoCl2-4 example in anintro.Rmd with different species
(CoCl2-4 has been added to OBIGT).

- add a demo to show user-added data with Berman equations

- make swap.basis() work when DEW model is active

[20210212]

- Fix formatting of messages from palply() (seen with read.fasta())

[20210219]

- Check all mineral abbreviations in Berman_cr.csv.

[20210301]

- anintro.Rmd: change red to blue for sulfur basis species

[20210303]

- Add demo for effective equilibrium constant for diglycine on T-pH plot at
  high pressure (DEW model; Robinson et al., 2021)

[20210306]

- Remove 'bases2' argument from mosaic() (old backward compatibility)

[20210312]

- Don't use z.T = NA to trigger AkDi model (makes the more common use case of
  just adding a simple aqueous species more tricky).
