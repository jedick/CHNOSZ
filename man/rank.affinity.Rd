\title{Average Ranks of Chemical Affinities}
\description{
Affinity rankings for groups of species.
}

\usage{
  rank.affinity(aout, groups, percent = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{aout}{list, output of \code{\link{affinity}}}
  \item{groups}{named list of indices (integer or numeric) for species in each group}
  \item{percent}{return average rank percentage for each group}
}

\details{
The affinities for all species are \code{\link{rank}}ed, then the mean ranking for the species in each group is calculated.
The mean rankings of groups are converted to a percentage, or returned as-is if \code{percent} is FALSE.
Note that the calculations are applied to each set of conditions individually (i.e., each grid point in the affinity \code{\link{affinity}} calculation).
}

\value{
The average rankings are inserted into the \code{values} element of \code{aout}, and the names of the groups are inserted into the \code{species} element.
The result can be used by \code{\link{diagram}} to make line plots or predominance diagrams (the predominance fields correspond to the groups with highest average ranking of affinity).
}

\note{
The reaction coefficients in the \code{species} element of the returned value of \code{aout} are not valid.
Because balancing on a basis species (i.e., dividing by its reaction coefficient) would be incorrect, \code{diagram} enforces \code{balance = 1} so that that average rankings are used without further modification.
